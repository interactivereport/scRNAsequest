## The config file to process public sc/sn RNAseq and generate h5ad for celldepot
output: OUTPUT_DIR
prefix: #the prefix of the file name of the h5ad
# seurat RDS is avaiable, otherwise please move to next section
seuratObj: #the full path to the seurat RDS file with SCT & RNA assay along with meta.data and reduction
seuratUMI: RNA # the name of the assay stores raw UMI
seuratSCT: SCT # the name of the assay stores SCT
seuratMeta: [] # the list of cell annotations to be stored in h5ad, empty list means all meta.data entry from seurat rds
# Expression when the seurat RDS is not available (row gene/column cell)
# if the annotation files are seperated the same as expression files, they should be the same order, other wise cell ID will be used to match
expression: [] # full path the gene expression file/folder (h5/csv/txt/mtx), if multiple files, please provide the list separated by ','
dataUMI: True #if the above expression is UMI, if the value in expression file should be used directly, please set "False"
# cell annotation (cell intersection will be used, first column is the cell ID)
annotation: [] # full path to the cell annotation file, first column is the cell ID which should match cell ID in expression
annotationUse: [] # the column names in the annotation file to be extracted for h5ad, empty list means all columns
sample_column: #one column header from annotation file, if the one expression file needs to be splited into each sample
# cell layout: tSNE, UMAP, PCA, if separated the same as expression files, should be the same order
reduction: #key 'files' required but other keys can be removed or added new ones, keys will be used in h5ad
  files: [] #full path to the cell layout file (contains all layouts of a set of cells), first column is the cell ID which should match cell ID in expression
  umap: [] # column headers from layout file to be used
  tsne: [] # column headers from layout file to be used
  pca: [] # column headers from layout file to be used (can be more than 2 dimentions though only first two will be shown in VIP)
