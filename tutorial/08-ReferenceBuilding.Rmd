# Reference Building

Reference building is critical for label transfer. To add a reference dataset into the scRNASequest pipeline, the reference matrix needs to be SCT transformed.

By running the following command, the reference will be added to the pipeline for future use:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
$ scRef

scRef /path/to/a/output/folder === or === scRef /path/to/a/Ref/config/file

The folder has to be existed.
The Ref config file will be generated automatically when a path is provided
===== CAUTION =====
	1. This process will add a seurat reference data into the scRNAsequest pipeline PERMANENTLY!
	2. Make sure the data provided for reference building is SCT transformed!
