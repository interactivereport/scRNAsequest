# Differential expression (DE) analysis

Another critical function of the scRNASequest pipeline is the **Differential expression (DE)** analysis. By running the steps in Section 6, we have performed quality control of the data, and generated an integrated dataset. 

Before running the DE analysis, the DEG.csv comparison file needs to be prepared:

In the DEG comparison file above, **“sample”**, **“cluster”**, **“group”** and **“covars”** are the annotation headers, and **“alt”** and **“ref”** are the entries from **“group”** column.

The DEG is performing between **“alt”** and **“ref”** cells from **“group”** within each entry of **“cluster”** considering **“sample”** variations.

Here, this tutorial provides several examples to illustrate the DE analysis in scRNASequest:

## Example 1


Here is an example of the DEG comparison file called DEGinfo.csv (header only):

```
sample,cluster,group,alt,ref,covars[+ separated],method[default NEBULA],model[default HL]
```

## Example 2

## Submit DE analysis


Once the DEGinfo.csv file created, it can be added to the config.yml file:

```
DEG_desp: ~/E-MTAB-11115/processing/DEGinfo.csv
```
