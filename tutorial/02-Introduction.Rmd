# Introduction

scRNASequest is a semi-automated single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data analysis workflow which allows the following five different functionalities:

- Pre-processing from raw single-cell RNA sequencing data, 

- Batch correction by one or multiple harmonization methods, 

- Reference-dataset-based cell type label transfer and embedding projection, 

- Multi-sample multi-condition single-cell level differential gene expression analysis

- Seamless integration with [cellxgene VIP](https://github.com/interactivereport/cellxgene_VIP){target="_blank"} for visualization and with [CellDepot](https://github.com/interactivereport/CellDepot){target="_blank"} for data hosting and sharing by generating a compatible h5ad file. Users have the option to run it on a local laptop computer or interact with sge/slurm schedulers on high performance computing (HPC) clusters.

This pipeline contains two main programs:

  - **scAnalyzer**
  
    This is the main script in scRNASequest for single-cell data processing and analysis.
    
    Also, scAnalyzer is an all-in-one program for downstream data analysis, including pre-processing, batch correction, label transfer, differential gene expression analysis and CellDepot integration. Moreover, scAnalyzer is embedded with a Bookdown report generator, named **scReport**, which can produce a user-friendly, well-structured quality control report after each run.
    
  - **scRef**
  
    scRef generates a reference dataset for label transfer. 
    
    For each reference dataset, this program only needs to run once, and the reference h5ad file will be placed in a permanent path.
