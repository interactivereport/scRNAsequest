[["index.html", "Bookdown report of E-MTAB-11115 Introduction", " Bookdown report of E-MTAB-11115 Generated on 2022-06-17 Introduction This is a summary report generated by scReport (part of scRNASequest pipeline) using Bookdown. This report contains basic QC plots generated by the pipeline. If you turn on the filter_step when running scAnalyzer, this report will also display QC plots before and after filtering. Please go through the figures carefully and decide the cutoffs for data filtering. Project Overview Here is a brief overview of the project and filtering criteria: Project Name: E-MTAB-11115 Project Title: Single-nucleus RNA-seq from adult mouse brain sections paired to 10X Visium spatial RNA-seq Filtering Option: TRUE Filtering Mitochondria: TRUE Filtering min.cells: 3 Filtering min.features: 50 Filtering highCount.cutoff: 10000 Filtering highGene.cutoff: 3000 For more details, please check the config.yml file and related config.yml.*.log file: /home/ysun4/E-MTAB-11115/config.yml "],["qc-plots.html", "Chapter 1 QC plots 1.1 General QC 1.2 Q30 Bases Percentage 1.3 Reads Mapping Summary", " Chapter 1 QC plots Quality control (QC) is of single-cell RNA-Seq experiment is critical to downstream analyses. In this section, we present a series of QC plots for better understanding of data quality. In total there are 19 figures showing different aspects of the data. These plots can be further grouped into the following categories: General QC Estimated Number of Cells Median UMI Counts per Cell Median Genes per Cell Number of Reads Mean Reads per Cell Total Genes Detected Valid Barcodes% Sequencing Saturation% Fraction Reads in Cells% Q30 Bases Percentage Q30 Bases in Barcode% Q30 Bases in RNA Read% Q30 Bases in UMI% Reads Mapping Summary Reads Mapped to Genome% Reads Mapped Confidently to Genome% Reads Mapped Confidently to Intergenic Regions% Reads Mapped Confidently to Intronic Regions% Reads Mapped Confidently to Exonic Regions% Reads Mapped Confidently to Transcriptome% Reads Mapped Antisense to Gene% 1.1 General QC The General QC plot section includes nine bar plots to visualize general metrics of the current single-cell project. 1.1.1 Estimated Number of Cells 1.1.2 Median UMI Counts per Cell 1.1.3 Median Genes per Cell 1.1.4 Number of Reads 1.1.5 Mean Reads per Cell 1.1.6 Total Genes Detected 1.1.7 Valid Barcodes% 1.1.8 Sequencing Saturation% 1.1.9 Fraction Reads in Cells% 1.2 Q30 Bases Percentage The Q30 Bases Percentage includes three Q30 plots showing Barcode%, RNA Read% and UMI%. 1.2.1 Q30 Bases in Barcode% 1.2.2 Q30 Bases in RNA Read% 1.2.3 Q30 Bases in UMI% 1.3 Reads Mapping Summary The Reads Mapping Summary section includes seven plots showing the percentage of reads mapped to different genomic features. Ideally, most of the reads should map to the Genome, as well as the Transcriptome. For single-nucleus RNA-seq data, we expect to see more reads mapped to the intronic region, compared to a single-cell RNA-seq data. 1.3.1 Genome% 1.3.2 Confidently to Genome% 1.3.3 Confidently to Intergenic Regions% 1.3.4 Confidently to Intronic Regions% 1.3.5 Confidently to Exonic Regions% 1.3.6 Confidently to Transcriptome% 1.3.7 Antisense to Gene% "],["pre-filtering-plots.html", "Chapter 2 Pre-filtering Plots 2.1 Counts and Genes 2.2 Number of Genes 2.3 Top Genes 2.4 Percentage of Top 50 Genes 2.5 Percentage of Top 100 Genes 2.6 Percentage of Top 200 Genes 2.7 Percentage of Top 500 Genes 2.8 Percentage of Mitochondria", " Chapter 2 Pre-filtering Plots In this section, we present 8 figures to visualize the statistics of genes and counts across multiple datasets in the current project. In a typical single-cell data, usually several thousand genes can be detected. However, the detection of many genes (i.e. over 10,000) may indicate more than one cells were sequenced. The plots shown here can be used as a guidance to determine the cutoff. If you have turned on “filter_step: True” in the config.yml file, you will also see post-filtering plots in the next section. 2.1 Counts and Genes This plot shows Total Counts (X axis) v.s. Genes (Y axis) detected in each data, before filtering. 2.2 Number of Genes This plot shows Number of Genes (Y axis) detected in each data, before filtering. 2.3 Top Genes This plot shows Top Genes and % of Total Counts in each data, before filtering. 2.4 Percentage of Top 50 Genes This plot shows % of Total Counts of top 50 genes, before filtering. 2.5 Percentage of Top 100 Genes This plot shows % of Total Counts of top 100 genes, before filtering. 2.6 Percentage of Top 200 Genes This plot shows % of Total Counts of top 200 genes, before filtering. 2.7 Percentage of Top 500 Genes This plot shows % of Total Counts of top 500 genes, before filtering. 2.8 Percentage of Mitochondria This plot shows % of Mitochondria, before filtering.

If any of the cutoffs were not ideal, please adjust the cutoff parameters in the config.yml file, then rerun scAnalyzer to generate this report again.
